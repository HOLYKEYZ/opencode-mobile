# codex-OC_mobile

Remote control Codex and OpenCode from your phone through a desktop relay.

```text
Phone --wss--> Relay Server <--wss-- Laptop relay
                                      |-- Codex local session
                                      `-- OpenCode local server
```

## Features

- Relay-only execution: the cloud server never calls model APIs and does not need API keys.
- QR or manual pairing: keep the same Render URL and swap only the session code/agent.
- Codex support: lists Codex app chats including loaded/current chats, opens a selected chat in Codex Desktop with `codex://local/<threadId>`, resumes/steers turns through the local Codex app-server, and blocks accidental new Codex sessions from the phone.
- OpenCode support: starts or reuses the local OpenCode HTTP server, lists recent OpenCode sessions, and prompts a selected session.
- Live phone transcript: shows user prompts, assistant responses, thinking/status events, shell/tool activity, and file-change summaries without dumping stale terminal noise.
- Technical event toggle: command output, aggregate tool lists, and file counts stay hidden unless explicitly enabled in Settings.
- Running-turn composer: while a turn is active, the send button shows progress; typing a draft changes it back to send so the prompt is steered into the active turn.
- Chat controls: refresh chat lists, collapse/show the chat list, copy the visible transcript, and jump back to the latest message when scrolled up.
- In-app update entry: Settings includes an update-page button for grabbing the latest APK.
- Desktop relay persistence: the relay keeps the same code across reconnects unless `backend/relay-state.json` is deleted or `AGENTHUB_RELAY_CODE` is changed.
- Background-friendly Android client: keeps the screen awake while open, preserves the selected chat/transcript, reconnects after socket drops, and refreshes state on resume.
- Voice input: Android/Google speech-to-text can fill the prompt box directly.
- File upload: phone attachments are copied to `.agenthub_uploads/` on the laptop and appended to the agent prompt.
- Multi-phone safe: every phone joined to the same session receives relay status and stream updates.
- Offline behavior: if the laptop relay is offline, the phone receives an offline error instead of falling back to cloud execution.

## Quick Start

### 1. Deploy the server

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HOLYKEYZ/vibe-app-slop.git
cd vibe-app-slop/backend
npm install
node server.js
```

Deploy `backend/` on Render as a Node.js web service. Port `3001`.

### 2. Install Android app

```bash
cd AgentHub
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

The APK is written to `AgentHub/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`.

### 3. Start the laptop relay

```bash
cd backend
npm install
SERVER_URL=wss://your-server.onrender.com node relay.js
```

The relay checks for signed-in local Codex/OpenCode installs and prints a QR code. Secrets stay on the laptop.

On Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
cd C:\Users\USER\.vscode\vibe_app_slop\backend
$env:SERVER_URL="wss://agent-hub-backend-wk48.onrender.com"
node relay.js
```

To force a new code:

```powershell
Remove-Item .\relay-state.json -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
$env:SERVER_URL="wss://agent-hub-backend-wk48.onrender.com"
node relay.js
```

### 4. Connect your phone

Open Agent Hub, scan the QR code, pick a visible chat, and send a prompt.

## Agents

| Agent | How it is driven |
|-------|------------------|
| Codex | Local `codex app-server` API first; CLI JSON resume only if explicitly enabled with `AGENTHUB_CODEX_CLI_FALLBACK=1` |
| OpenCode | Local `opencode serve` HTTP API on `127.0.0.1:4096` |

## Environment

| Env | Default | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `PORT` | `3001` | Relay server port |
| `SERVER_URL` | `ws://localhost:3001` | Relay server URL used by `relay.js` |
| `AGENTHUB_CWD` | repo root | Working directory for local agents |
| `OPENCODE_PORT` | `4096` | Local OpenCode server port |
| `CODEX_APP_SERVER_URL` | `ws://127.0.0.1:4545` | Local Codex app-server URL |
| `AGENTHUB_RELAY_CODE` | unset | Optional fixed relay code |
| `AGENTHUB_CODEX_CLI_FALLBACK` | unset | Set to `1` to allow Codex CLI resume fallback |

## Notes

- The phone app can keep `wss://agent-hub-backend-wk48.onrender.com` as the server URL. The session code and selected agent are separate settings.
- The cloud server is only a WebSocket switchboard between phone and laptop relay. Codex/OpenCode credentials and files stay on the laptop.
- Uploads are stored under `.agenthub_uploads/` in the relay working directory.
- If the exact screenshot asset is needed, save it under `docs/screenshots/` and replace the README image path.
